      <p> This website brings together several lda topic model visualizations. 
      The visualizations are intended to help the user make sense of the topic model and how well it has been fit on the corpus.
      As such, it provides views of the topics and the words that define them. 
      In addition, you can also search documents and see mixture of topics it contains.
      </p>

      <p> The <b>ldavis</b> page uses the view created by the <a href="https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis"> R ldavis package</a>. 
      Importantly, the topics are not sorted by their size as is done by default with ldavis, so the development version of R ldavis is used, 
      since in that version you can specify you don't want the topics sorted.
      </p>

      <p> The <b>doctopics</b> page allows the user to explore in more detail the mixture of topics in a document. 
      Search by document title to see the document topic probabilites for that document. 
      Click on the bars to see the topic terms probabilites and the 'most salient terms' for that topic as derived from R ldavis.
      </p>

      <p> The <b>cssdoctopics</b> page provides another view of the topic probabilites for a document.
      Search by document title to see the five topics with the highest probability.
      A box is created for each topic that is filled with most frequently occuring words in that topic.
      Each word in the document that matches with one of the words from the boxes is assigned a color based on the topic it occured most in.
      </p>

      <p> the <b>topicdocs</b> page provides a way to get a sense of a given topic.
      Search by topic id to see the documents with the highest probability of having that topic.
      As with cssdoctopics, the most frequent words of the topic are highlighted in the document.
